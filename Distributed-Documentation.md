# SUMMA-Distributed
SUMMA-Distributed is an actor program that can compute the solution to HRUs using multiple computers connected in a network.
To achieve this we had to introduce two new actors into SUMMA-Actors the client actor and the server actor. These actors in combintaiton can 
compute the solution to HRUs.

To use distributed mode. Set the distributed
