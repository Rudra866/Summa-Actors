# SUMMA-Actors Documentation Guide

SUMMA-Actors is a beta software that currently does not have the full capabilities of the original version of SUMMA. The most notable 
feature not currently implemented is the simulation of lateral flows. SUMMA-Actors can solve for HRUs that do not have any dependencies on other HRUs. Although we are working to implement the full functionality of SUMMA into SUMMA-Actors.

The documentation is organized as follows. We provide information for installing SUMMA-Actors on your system as well as some information for how to install SUMMA-Actors on Clusters such as the ones provided by Compute Canada.
