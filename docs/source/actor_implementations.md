# Normal Summa (No Distributed)

## Summa Actor
This is the top level actor that is spawned after the user invokes the program.
This actor is used to control job actors and batch sizes. The user can specifies how large a simulation of GRUs should be from the command line. This actor can then break that into smaller jobs to save on RAM.
